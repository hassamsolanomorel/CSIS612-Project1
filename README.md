# CSIS612-Project1
## Matrix Multiplication: Iterative vs Thread Based Algorithms

### About

  This repository contains the source code needed to run a simple program that compares
  two approaches to matrix multiplication.

### Running The Program

#### Dependencies
- Python3.6+
- Git CLI tool
- Python library: NumPy

#### Steps to run
1. Clone this repo to your local machine:

    ```git clone https://github.com/hassamsolanomorel/CSIS612-Project1.git```

2. Ensure you’re local machine has python3.6 or above:
    ```python --version’ or ‘python3 --version```

   If you don’t have version 3.6 or above you can install it by following the instructions [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

3. Install numpy:
    ```pip3 install --user numpy```

4. CD to the root directory of the project:
    ```cd path/to/project```

5. Run the project by replacing ‘INT_SIZE’ with the size of the square matrix you would like to compute:

    ```python3 matrixmultiply.py <INT_SIZE>```
